Local Changes? checkout
Staged Changes? reset
Committed Changes? Revert

Stick to this. If anyone does a 
reset on published code you stab them.

Revert
Revert is best for commits.
Revert is safe.
If you want to undo the changes from a commit use revert.
	$git revert
	$git revert commit
	$git revert commit-range
This will create a new commit with equal and opposite changes,
cancelling out the selected commits.

Reset
Reset is best for staged changes.
Use it to unstage changes you don't want staged.
	$git reset file
Stick to this useage. Don't tryout --hard just because
you don't know how to undo something. Git tells you when to
use reset.

Checkout
Checkout is best for local changes.
If you have unstaged, uncommitted work that you just want gone,
use git checkout.
	$git checkout file
	$git checkout -- .
This just gets the stuff back from head and throws away your stuff.

Clean
Just don't do it.
	$git clean ;; Just don't, it's dangerous.
	$git clean -fdx ;; ah, whatever. try it. learn a lesson.
Seriously dont.
